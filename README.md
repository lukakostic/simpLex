# simpLex
Simple and fast lexer in C++ header (and example of json output)     
   
Easy to modify. Can register new symbols and identifiers at runtime.  
Useful if your language needs user-defined operators at runtime (operators 'split' text like spaces!)   
  
Comes with an example usage file `example.cpp + example.txt` which prints out the json of all symbols parsed.
